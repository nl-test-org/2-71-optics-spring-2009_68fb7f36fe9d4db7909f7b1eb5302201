Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, one 1-hour session and one 2-hour session

Prerequisites
-------------

[8.02 Physics II](/courses/8-02-physics-ii-electricity-and-magnetism-spring-2007) (or equivalent)  
[18.03SC Differential Equations](/courses/18-03sc-differential-equations-fall-2011)  
[2.004 Dynamics and Control II](/courses/2-004-systems-modeling-and-control-ii-fall-2007) or permission of the instructor

Collaboration
-------------

Working with others on the homework is allowed, but you should write your own solutions and make sure you understand them before handing in. Projects are collaborative by definition.

Late Policy
-----------

We will accept late homework but you lose 20% of the grade per day after the due date. The 1st homework is exempt from this policy (but please make sure to turn it in by the due date of the 2nd homework.)

Homework/Quiz Exemptions
------------------------

In emergency situations, please contact the instructor and the TA to request extensions. In some occasions, we might require you to provide a note from MIT Medical or one of the counseling deans.

Final Exam
----------

The final exam is regulated by the Registrar's office. Standard Institute policies apply for absence from the final exam.

Grading Policies
----------------

Undergraduate students are recommended to enroll for 2.71. Graduate students and advanced undergraduate students, particularly those planning to pursue optics at the graduate level, should enroll for 2.710. Students in 2.710 will complete extra homework problems and a group project.

| ACTIVITIES | PERCENTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| 2.71 | 2.710 |
| --- | --- |
| Homework | 30% | 25% |
| Quizzes | 40% | 30% |
| Projects | n/a | 20% |
| Final exam | 30% | 25% 

### Homework Grading

Each problem is worth 3 points; you earn

*   all 3 points if you solve the problem perfectly,
*   2 points if you got the main idea but made minor error(s)
*   1 point if you went seriously astray
*   0 points if you did not attempt the problem

### Term Grades

We do **not** grade on a curve; we use the [Institute grade definitions](http://web.mit.edu/academic-guide/section_06.html).
